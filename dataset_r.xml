        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see a lot of questions within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IT&quot;&gt;r/IT&lt;/a&gt; community asking how to get into IT, what path to follow, what is needed, etc. For everyone it is going to be different but there is a similar path that we can all take to make it a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have limited/no experience in IT (or don&amp;#39;t have a degree) it is best to start with certifications. CompTIA is, in my opinion, the best place to start. Following in this order: A+, Network+, and Security+. These are a great place to start and will lay a foundation for your IT career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are resources to help you earn these certificates but they don&amp;#39;t always come cheap. You can take CompTIA&amp;#39;s online learning (live online classroom environment) but at $2,000 USD, this will be cost prohibitive for a lot of people. CBT Nuggets is a great website but it is not free either (I do not have the exact price). You can also simply buy the books off of Amazon. Fair warning with that: they make for VERY dry reading and the certification exams are not easy (for me they weren&amp;#39;t, at least).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After those certifications, you will then have the opportunity to branch out. At that time, you should have the knowledge of where you would like to go and what IT career path you would like to pursue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I like to stress that a college/university degree is NOT necessary to get into the IT field but will definitely help. What degree you choose is strictly up to you but I know quite a few people with a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of us (degree or not) will start in a help desk environment. Do not feel bad about this; it&amp;#39;s a great place to learn and the job is vital to the IT department. A lot of times it is possible to get into a help desk role with no experience but these roles will limit what you are allowed to work on (call escalation is generally what you will do).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please do not hesitate to ask questions, that is what we are all here for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would encourage my fellow IT workers to add to this post, fill in the blanks that I most definitely missed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/stackjr&quot;&gt; /u/stackjr &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/tx4ifd/some_steps_for_getting_into_it/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/tx4ifd/some_steps_for_getting_into_it/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Lightly tapping my laptop&amp;#39;s touchpad with one finger for L-click &amp;amp; two fingers for R-click work perfect, though, so that isn&amp;#39;t my issue.

Does it need to be one of the netgear stackable series because of our MDF? What would be the best way to connect the MDF to the IDF? My plan is to just cat 6 straight through.

Nor can i access gameservers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the only two things that would make me feel better while I&amp;#39;m in here so the fact that I&amp;#39;m not able to do this really hurts right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is there anyone who can help me? or who can direct me to a subreddit where they might be able to help me?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Kakkernijntje&quot;&gt; /u/Kakkernijntje &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wciu0m/help_restricted_internet_access_in_hospital/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wciu0m/help_restricted_internet_access_in_hospital/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good day everyone, I’m new to this group. I need some advice. I’m going to graduate next month in IT but I don’t know what job I’m going to apply for. I tried my best to learn programming but it’s really hard for me. But I can say I’m good at designing, which is UI/UX designer but I’m not sure if I can apply or relate it to I.T. I’m really stressed right now and it’s hard to find a job as well. Anyone can give me an idea and advice. I was thinking also about the analyst but I don’t know how to start I don’t want to waste what I studied though I admit I’m not into code. And most of the companies also are looking for an experience which is I don’t have yet. 🥺&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/InsideNo5892&quot;&gt; /u/InsideNo5892 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wck3um/need_advice/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wck3um/need_advice/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>

Only trade school. I really enjoy working as a commercial hvac service tech however I want to travel. I want to be free to move around and hvac isn&amp;#39;t very travel friendly. I&amp;#39;m currently making around $50,000 without overtime but with commercial hvac there is alot of overtime so take that as you will. I&amp;#39;m thinking walking into the IT field. Is this a good idea? And what is the job outlook? I understand I&amp;#39;ll start out as like a pc tech or something but as far as a year in how much can I progress? I&amp;#39;d like to learn powershell and get into automation.

        <content type="html">&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;md&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents and I (who are very inexperienced in anything IT) been trying to extend Our Wifi signal to reach downstairs (specifically my room) because it gets no signal and rarely 1 or 2 bars. My Step Dad ended up getting a TP link router in an attempt to use it as an extender but when I try to connect to it, it has no internet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I took a look at the way my Step Dad set it up and did some reaserch and realized the problem. Because there was no WAN cable plugged in to the modem, it wouldn&amp;#39;t work. But I can&amp;#39;t connect it to the modem because they&amp;#39;re on 2 different floors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which one of these solutions is the best: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A: Get one of those Xfinity Pods&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B: Buy another Modem (If that even works) so I can connect the WAN cable to it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;C: If there&amp;#39;s a way to connect the 2 of them wirelessly let me know&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt; &amp;#32; submitted by &amp;#32; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/Kurai_Tsuki_987&quot;&gt; /u/Kurai_Tsuki_987 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wc3dos/trying_to_extend_xfinity_wifi_downstairs_with_tp/&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#32; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/it/comments/wc3dos/trying_to_extend_xfinity_wifi_downstairs_with_tp/&quot;&gt;[comments]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content>
